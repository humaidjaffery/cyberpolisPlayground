    <h1 class="ml-1">The formula f = wx+b is a simple base example of a linear regression function which we'll be working with throughout this course. But, Linear regression functions sometimes need to be more complex to be able to fit the data correctly. </h1>
    <h1>The function can have multiple input (<i>x</i>) variables that need to be considered (e.g. we also factor in the traffic with temperature in the example above). The function would then look like this: <div data-katex="'f = w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b'" ></div></h1>
    <h1>Sometimes, when a relationship can not be "best-fit" with just a linear line, <span class="font-bold">Polynomial Regression</span> can be used, which just uses non-linear functions instead of just x. For example:  
        <div data-katex="'f = wx^2 + b'" ></div> or
        <div data-katex="'f = wsin(x) + b'" ></div>
    </h1>
    <h1 class="mt-1">For this course, we are just focusing on the basics with a <span class="font-bold">one-input linear</span> regression model, but what you learn here can be easily generalized to more complex multi-input or polynomial regression models</h1>
